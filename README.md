# VSCode Extension Minimal Sample

The extension looks for `{ ln: number fl: number }` or `{ ln: number cl: number fl: String }` or `{ in line: number file: String }` in the current file and highlights them in the open text editor.

## Running the Sample

- Run `npm install` in terminal to install dependencies
- Run the `Run Extension` target in the Debug View or press `F5` on your keyboard and select the VSCode Extension Development.
